It originated in Zuckerberg's dorm room at Harvard University in February 2004. The initial purpose was to create a platform that allowed Harvard students to connect and interact with each other online.</li>
                        <li class = "lead"><i class = "fas fa-dot-circle"></i> On February 4, 2004, Mark Zuckerberg launched the website "Thefacebook.com" for Harvard students. The site's success quickly led to its expansion to other Ivy League universities and later to universities across the United States and Canada. It became a hit among college students for its simplicity and exclusivity.</li>
                        <li class = "lead"><i class = "fas fa-dot-circle"></i> In 2005, the company dropped "The" from its name and became simply "Facebook." This change reflected the company's desire to expand beyond colleges and universities and connect people worldwide. The decision to open the platform to high school students and eventually the general public marked a significant shift in its mission and reach.</li>
                        <li class = "lead"><i class = "fas fa-dot-circle"></i>Facebook's origin marked the beginning of a social media revolution. It introduced features like the "Wall" and "News Feed," which changed how people shared information and interacted online. Facebook's rapid growth and global expansion made it one of the widely used social networking platforms, transforming the way people connect, communicate, and share content.
